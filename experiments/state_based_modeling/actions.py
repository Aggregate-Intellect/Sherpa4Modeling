        identify the Player-Role pattern within the current classes
        
        Player-Role pattern is a design pattern in modeling.
        When modeling, it is common to encounter situations where one wants to make multiple subclasses, but can not or should not for various reasons. One reason not to create a subclass is because instances may need to change class as their roles in the system change. Another reason not to create a subclass is because an instance may need to play two or more roles smultaneously.
        The solution is to create a Role class and to link it by a many-to-one association to the main class (which we will call the Player class). 
        Create a Player class to represent the object that plays different roles. Create an association from this class to an abstract Role class, which is the superclass of a set of possible roles. The subclasses of this Role class encapsulate all the features associated with the different roles.
        
        For example: For the classes Student, FullTimeStudent, PartTimeStudent, with the normal super class and subclass relationship,
        an instance of the Student cannot switch from FullTimeStudent to PartTimeStudent, as the instance cannot change type.
        So we need the player role pattern as following:
        
        ```
        Student(string name, string id)
        abstract AttendanceRole()
        FullTimeStudent(int fullTimeCredit) inherit AttendenceRole()
        PartTimeStudent(int partTimeCredit) inherit AttendenceRole()
        ```

        Here are more examples:

        Example 1. Within the school system, the student has two roles, graduate student and undergraduate student.
        The student can be a undergrad student at some point, and then switch to the role of graduate student.
        The student class saved information shared by both roles and is associated to the LevelRole.
        Both GraduateStudent and UndergradStudent inherit from the LevelRole class.
        
        ```
        Student(string name)
        abstract LevelRole()
        GraduateStudent(float graduateGpa) inherit LevelRole()
        UndergradStudentfloat undergradGpa inherit LevelRole()
        ```

        Example 2. Within the company system, each person has two roles, employee and manager.
        The Person can be an employee at some point, and then switch to the manager role later.
        
        ```
        Person(string name, string email, string address)
        abstract PersonRole()
        Employee(string employeeID) inherit PersonRole()
        Manager(string title) inherit PersonRole()
        ```
        
        Example 3. Within the system, each user has two roles, administrator and player.
        The user can be an administrator at some point, and then switch to the player role, or each user can have two roles at the same time.

        ```
        User(string userEmail, string userId)
        abstract UserRole()
        Administrator(string adminName, string adminPassword) inherit UserRole()
        Player(string playAccountName) inherit UserRole()
        ```

        Example 4. Within the conference system, each user has three roles: author, program chair, and reviewer.
        The user can have 1-3 roles at the same time. For example, the user can publish a paper as the author, work as a program chair, and review other papers at the same time.

        ```
        User(string username, string password)
        abstract UserRole()

        Player-Role pattern is a design pattern in modeling.
        When modeling, it is common to encounter situations where one wants to make multiple subclasses, but can not or should not for various reasons. One reason not to create a subclass is because instances may need to change class as their roles in the system change. Another reason not to create a subclass is because an instance may need to play two or more roles smultaneously.
        The solution is to create a Role class and to link it by a many-to-one association to the main class (which we will call the Player class).
