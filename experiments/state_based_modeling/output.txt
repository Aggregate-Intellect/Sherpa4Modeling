        Many classes may not be needed and may not be necessary, example cases:
        - if class A is too detailed to be included in the system, consider removing it.
        - if class A does not contain any attributes or only contains 1 attribute, consider moving the attribute of class A to another class and removing class A
        - For the enumeration class, evaluate if it should be captured by an attribute and if its literals are necessary
        - For the subclasses, evaluate if they are necessary to be present in the system.



['To create a domain model for the LabTracker software, we need to identify the key entities (classes) and their attributes based on the problem description. Here is a proposed class list with comments evaluating their necessity and abstraction level:', '1. **Doctor**', '- **Attributes**: practitioner number, signature, full name, address, phone number', '- **Comment**: This class is necessary as it encapsulates all the information related to a doctor, which is crucial for managing requisitions.', '2. **Patient**', '- **Attributes**: health number, first name, last name, date of birth, address, phone number', '- **Comment**: This class is essential as it represents the patients who are the primary users of the system for booking tests and viewing results.', '3. **Requisition**', '- **Attributes**: doctor (reference to Doctor), patient (reference to Patient), valid from date, test group, repetition pattern (times, interval)', '- **Comment**: This class is necessary as it represents the order for tests, linking doctors and patients, and includes details about the tests to be performed.', '4. **Test**', '- **Attributes**: test name, duration, type (e.g., blood, ultrasound), result (positive/negative), report', '- **Comment**: This class is crucial as it defines the individual tests that can be part of a requisition, including their results and reports.', '5. **Lab**', '- **Attributes**: name, address, registration number, business hours, change/cancellation fee', '- **Comment**: This class is necessary as it represents the labs where tests are conducted, including their operational details.', '6. **Appointment**', '- **Attributes**: requisition (reference to Requisition), lab (reference to Lab), confirmation number, date, start time, end time', '- **Comment**: This class is essential for managing the scheduling of tests that require appointments, linking requisitions to specific labs and times.', '7. **TestGroup**', '- **Attributes**: group name, list of tests', '- **Comment**: This class is necessary to enforce the rule that only tests from the same group can be combined on a requisition.', '8. **RepetitionPattern**', '- **Attributes**: interval (weekly, monthly, half-yearly, yearly), number of repetitions', '- **Comment**: This class is useful for encapsulating the repetition logic for tests, ensuring clarity and reusability.', '9. **BusinessHours**', '- **Attributes**: start time, end time', '- **Comment**: This class is useful for defining the operational hours of a lab, ensuring consistency and easy updates.', '**General Comments**:', '- The proposed classes are at the correct level of abstraction, focusing on the core entities and their relationships within the LabTracker system.', '- Each class encapsulates a distinct set of attributes and responsibilities, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.', "- The inclusion of classes like `TestGroup` and `RepetitionPattern` helps manage specific business rules and patterns, enhancing the system's flexibility and maintainability.", '- The `BusinessHours` class, while simple, provides a structured way to handle lab hours, which could be extended in the future if needed.', 'Overall, the proposed classes align well with the problem description and provide a solid foundation for implementing the LabTracker software.']
